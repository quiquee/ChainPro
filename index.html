<h2>ChainPro - Onchain Project Budgeting Tool</h2>
  ChainPro enables creation of budget trees like the one that shows below.
  It allows the definition of the budget at any level of the tree and the
  allocation of budget using hyerarchical deterministic addresses.
  This allows any organization to use a virtual currency to distribute Budget
  and empower those with budget responsibilities to transfer it.
  <P>
  Using any blockchain that supports hyerarchical deterministic wallets You
  can monitor budget allocation in real time, as well as budget expenditure.
  <P>
  Any budget owner can use a bitcoin compatible wallet to make payments to
  other people in the organization. This can be easily monitored by all upper
  levels in the hirarchy.
  <P>
  Suppose you are a CEO of a company and have three departments under your
  responsability, Marketing, run by the Chief Marketing Officer, Operations,
  run by the Chief Operations Officer (COO) and the finance department, run
  by your Chief Operating Officer (CFO)
  <p>
  At the beginning of the period you make payments to each of them for the
  amount that you decide they should spend. Each of them can then talk to their
  direct reports and distribute this amount or part of it, among then so they
  can use it to pay their teams.
