#Branches
This shall be the **nodebased** branch
There are so far 2 other branches in this repo:
* **ethConcept** , a html + vue working version that connects to Metamask and derives addresses using BIP32 / BIP39. A demo can be accessed at [this link](https://quiquee.github.io/ChainPro/)

* **master** , the original vue tree , with no connection or address derivation
